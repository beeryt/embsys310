# EMBSYS 310 - Assignment 03

1. Follow the same steps as we did in the class to blink LED1 (PA5) at a visible rate.

    >**See [blink.c](blink.c).**


2. Use the XOR bitwise operator to toggle the LED.

    >**See [blink.c:46](blink.c#L46).**


3. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings:
    1. What is Morse Code?
    
        >**Morse code is a form of communicating via a sequence of dots and dashes. International morse code supports case insensitive letters A-Z and numbers 0-9. Each symbol is defined by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot is the base unit of time and the duration of a dash is 3 units. Each dot/dash is followed by a 1 unit silence. A gap between letters is defiend as 3 units and a gap between words is 7 units.**
    
    2. Who developed Morse Code?
    
        >**Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail are credited with developing Morse code in the early nineteenth century while developing electric signalling systems via telegraph.**


4. Using the International Code below, please write a small program to present your *first name* with Morse Code using hte user LED on our B-L475-IOT01A1 evaluation board.

    >**See [morse.c](morse.c).**

5. Use the STM32CubeMx tool to generate the boiler plate code for controlling LED1 & LED2.
    1. Implement a simple blinking LED program using the code generated by the tool.

    >**See [boilerplate.c:97](boilerplate.c#L97).**
