# EMBSYS 310 - Assignment 03

1. Follow the same steps as we did in the class to blink LED1 (PA5) at a visible rate.


2. Use the XOR bitwise operator to toggle the LED.


3. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings:
    1. What is Morse Code?
    2. Who developed Morse Code?


4. Using the International Code below, please write a small program to present your *first name* with Morse Code using hte user LED on our B-L475-IOT01A1 evaluation board.


5. Use the STM32CubeMx tool to generate the boiler plate code for controlling LED1 & LED2.
    1. Implement a simple blinking LED program using the code generated by the tool.
