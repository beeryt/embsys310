## **1. Embedded device example**
**Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.**


The telegraph example is an embedded system with primary data flow towards the embedded device.
In the IoT space a common application is a remote sensor embedded system with primary data flow away from the device.
More specifically, a project I have put some thought into is a remote temperature/humidity sensor for beehives.
The primary design challenges with such a system are:
- Reliability: bees will cover *everything* in propolis
- Power consumption: being outdoors brings potential for energy harvesting
- Cost: beekeeping is an expensive hobby on its own
The general design is simply a microcontroller with a temp/humidy sensor and radio module.
With the above design challenges enclosure design and power management are key to a long-term, reliable solution.
Making use of processor sleep modes and choosing low-power components goes a long way towards preserving battery life.
With an outdoor application solar energy harvesting is an option, but the lower power consumption also means cheaper solar cells.
