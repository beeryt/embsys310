## **2. Two's Complement**
**Why use two's complement to represent negative numbers?**

The two's complement is a convenient method for representing negative integers in binary. Determining the twos complement can be done by inverting each bit (one's complement), then adding one. This process is reversible: (0001) -> (1111) -> (0001) in 4-bit binary follows (1) -> (-1) -> (1) in decimal.

A major advantage of two's complement is that basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication are identical to their unsigned counterparts. This means the same ALU can be used for both signed and unsigned arithmetic.
