# EMBSYS 310 - Assignment 04

## Problems
### Problem 1
>For implementation:
>
>See [blink.c](blink.c)

#### 1.a What instructions does the compiler produce in assembly for "writing to the ~~GPIO~~ GPIOAEN bit when using bit-band alias?

>The assembly puts 1 in `R0`, loads the address of the bit-band alias, `0x4242980` into `R1`, then stores `R0` into the memory referenced by `R1`.
```asm
  PERIPHERAL_BIT_BAND(RCC_AHB2ENR_ADDR, GPIOAEN_BIT) = 1;
MOVS    R0, #1
LDR.N   R1, [PC, $0x40] ; 0x42420980
STR     R0, [R1]
```

#### 1.b What were the instructions produced when writing to the GPIOx_ODR register without using bit-banding?

>The assembly loads the GPIOA_ODR address, `0x48000014`, into `R0`. Then loads the value at that address into `R1`. An exclusive or operation is performed on bit 5 (`0x20`) and the resulting `R1` is stored into the memory referenced by `R0`.
```asm
  GPIOA_ODR ^= OD5;
LDR.N   R0, [PC, #0x20] ; 0x48000014
LDR     R1, [R0]
EORS.W  R1, R1, #32     ; 0x20
STR     R1, [R0]
```


### Problem 2
>For implementation:
>
>See [func.c](func.c).

```asm
func1:
  BX      LR
void func2() {
func2:
  PUSH    {R7, LR}
  func1(1,2,3,4,5);
  MOVS    R0, #5
  STR     R0, [SP]
  MOVS    R3, #4
  MOVS    R2, #3
  MOVS    R1, #2
  MOVS    R0  #1
  BL      func1
}
  POP     {R0, PC}
int main() {
main:
  PUSH    {R7, LR}
  func2();
  BL      func2
}
  MOVES   R0, #0
  POP     {R1, PC}
```

#### 2.a How does the *calling* function `func2` pass the values to the *called* function `func1`?

>Inside the dissasembly of `func2` the fifth argument (`#5`) is placed onto the stack (without decrementing SP?). The first four arguments are placed in `R0-R3`. A `BL` instruction branches to the `func1` label.
```asm
MOVS    R0, #5
STR     R0, [SP]
MOVS    R3, #4
MOVS    R2, #3
MOVS    R1, #2
MOVS    R0  #1
BL      func1
```

#### 2.b What extra code did the compiler generate before calling the function `func1` with the multiple arguments?

>The dissasembly shows a `PUSH {R7, LR}` instruction pushes `LR` onto the stack so we can return from `func2` (`main` does this as well).
```asm
PUSH    {R7, LR}
```


#### 2.c What extra code did the compiler generate inside the *called* function `func1` with the multiple list of arguments?

>There is no *extra* code here. Just a branch back to `LR` which at this time is inside `func2` after the `BL` instruction.
```asm
BX    LR
```

#### 2.d Any other observations?

>I wanted to invesitage why the fifth argument (`#5`) didn't decrement `SP` inside `func2`. I modified `func1` as follows:
```C
int func1(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5) {
  return a5;
}
```
```asm
func1:
  PUSH    {R4}
  MOVS    R4, R0
  LDR     R0, [SP, #0x4]
  return a5;
  POP     {R4}
  BX      LR
```
>The new disassembly of `func1` shows a strange dance with the stack, `R4` and `R0`. I'm really not sure what the `PUSH`, `MOVS`, and `POP` instructions accomplish here. The `LDR R0, [SP, #0x4]` reads from the stack without moving `SP`. The `#0x4` is an `int` offset to avoid the `R4` which had just been pushed.

>I feel that the contents of `func1` could be written more succinctly:
```asm
func1:
  LDR   R0, [SP]
  BX    LR
```
>Most baffling is the `MOVS` instruction which appears to place the value of `a1` into `R4` before immediately overwritting it by popping into `R4`.


### Problem 3
>For implementation:
>
>See [stack.h](stack.h) for stack API<br>
>See [stack.c](stack.c) for stack implementation and design<br>
>See [stack_test.c](stack_test.c) for test cases

> I used [Unity][link-unity] for a convenient test framework. I discovered it while playing around with [Platform IO][link-pio] which uses it as their default [unit testing][link-unit-pio] framework. I personally prefer [gtest][link-gtest], but it is a C++ library and I didn't want to mix C/C++ for this assignment.

> A challenge I wanted to impose on myself was supporting multiple stack instances and using an opaque struct in the API with *private* implementation in `stack.c`. Usually this approach involves a `stack_create`/`stack_delete` combo which uses `malloc` and friends. However, since this is an embedded target I chose to statically allocate a *"pool"* of structs. Interestingly my memory management for this *pool* is also implemented as a stack. I have stacks within stacks.

> Output of `endian.c` is provided through UART over USB. In the future I would like to use UART, DMA and a FIFO buffer to reduce CPU overhead.
